# Social-Distancing-Alert-System

This circuit is an example of a Social distancing Alert system that detects the objects around it in a specific range (1-3 m), so it gives an alarm when something is so close, Moreover it gives an indicator of how close the object is using special leds. Simple components were used to design this, starting from the basic Arduino UNO, a buzzer to give the alarm, ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and special leds component called NeoPixel Ring.
